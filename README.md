# MinMus-Donation-Card-Maker
Program to automate the creation of sales cards from donations. Requires the openpyxl library. Lots of improvements that could be made, I haven't touched it since I left in Aug 2021. If it actually gets used I will most likely update.
I think like 3 people will actually ever use this :/

info.xlsx is an old example donation sheet I used for testing; otherwise referred to as the "source sheet"
the two CardTemplate files are somewhat self explanatory, referred to as the "destination sheet"
